### Home-Detection-Lab 

#### Introduction
Building a home detection lab is an excellent way to gain practical experience in cybersecurity. This project involves setting up a virtual environment with a Windows 10 machine and a Kali Linux machine, installing and configuring necessary tools like Splunk and Sysmon on the Windows machine, and conducting simulated attacks to detect malware activity. This setup helps in understanding how to generate and analyze telemetry data to detect malicious activities on a target system.

#### Objectives
1. **Setup Virtual Environment:** Install and configure VirtualBox to create isolated virtual machines.
2. **Install and Configure Windows 10:** Set up Windows 10 as the target machine with Splunk and Sysmon.
3. **Install and Configure Kali Linux:** Set up Kali Linux as the attacker machine.
4. **Simulate Attacks:** Use Kali Linux to scan and attack the Windows 10 machine.
5. **Detect and Analyze Malware:** Monitor and detect malicious activities on Windows 10 using Splunk.

#### Skills Learned
- Setting up and managing virtual machines using VirtualBox.
- Installing and configuring Windows 10 and Kali Linux.
- Installing and configuring Splunk and Sysmon for security monitoring.
- Performing network scans and simulating attacks using Nmap and custom malware.
- Analyzing telemetry data to detect and respond to security threats.

#### Tools Used
- **VirtualBox:** For creating and managing virtual machines.
- **Windows 10:** As the target machine.
- **Kali Linux:** As the attacker machine.
- **Splunk:** For collecting and analyzing security data.
- **Sysmon:** For enhanced logging and monitoring on Windows.
- **Nmap:** For network scanning and reconnaissance.
- **Custom Malware:** For simulating a real-world attack.

#### Steps Taken

1. **Install VirtualBox:**
   - Download and install VirtualBox from the official website.
   - Ensure VirtualBox is up to date.

2. **Create Virtual Machines:**
   - **Windows 10 VM:** Install Windows 10 as a virtual machine.
     - Allocate sufficient resources (RAM, CPU, storage).
   - **Kali Linux VM:** Install Kali Linux as a virtual machine.
     - Allocate sufficient resources and configure networking.

3. **Configure Networking:**
   - Set both virtual machines to use a Host-Only Adapter to ensure they can communicate without affecting the host machine.
   - Verify network connectivity between Windows 10 and Kali Linux.

4. **Install Windows 10:**
   - Complete the installation process and disable Windows Defender to avoid interference.
   - Update Windows 10 to the latest version.

5. **Install Splunk on Windows 10:**
   - Download and install Splunk from the official website.
   - Configure Splunk to start on boot and set up basic logging.

6. **Install Sysmon on Windows 10:**
   - Download Sysmon from the Sysinternals website.
   - Install Sysmon with a configuration file to enable detailed logging of system events.

7. **Install Kali Linux:**
   - Complete the installation process and update Kali Linux.
   - Install necessary tools such as Nmap.

8. **Simulate Attacks:**
   - Use Nmap from Kali Linux to scan the Windows 10 machine for open ports.
   - Develop a custom malware executable and run it on the Windows 10 machine.

9. **Monitor and Detect:**
   - Use Splunk on Windows 10 to collect and analyze logs generated by Sysmon.
   - Look for indicators of the Nmap scan and malware execution in the Splunk logs.

10. **Analyze Results:**
    - Identify key telemetry data indicating the presence of an attack.
    - Document the findings and understand how Splunk and Sysmon can be used to detect such activities.

#### Conclusion
This home detection lab project provides hands-on experience in setting up a secure virtual environment, simulating cyber attacks, and detecting malicious activities using Splunk and Sysmon. By following these steps, one gains a deeper understanding of how to monitor, analyze, and respond to security threats effectively. This foundational knowledge is essential for aspiring cybersecurity professionals to develop robust security monitoring and incident response capabilities.
